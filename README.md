# README

Welcome to my movie database. This is a single page application for keeping track of your movie collection. Add movies to the database by title, then write a brief description, add a movie poster and choose the genre of the movie. You can even search for a movie title to see if you already have it. The frontend of this application is written in HTML/CSS/Javascript and connected to Ruby on Rails for the backend.

## Backend

The Rails API backend for this project is located [here](https://github.com/travelingwheels/Movies_Frontend.git)

## Install and Usage

1. Fork and clone this repository to your computer.
2. Follow the link to the Backend repository. Fork and clone to your computer. Run 'bundle install' and 'rails db:migrate' then start a rails server.
3. With the server running, open the 'index.html' file in your browser.

Simply fill out the form and click submit to add your movies to the database, or you can use the search bar at the top of the page to find a title you've prevously entered.
